# Invite Manager

Small bot built on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev) for the [Cloudflare Discord](https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev). Built with the [Slshx](https://github.com/mrbbot/slshx) library.

This bot is made to manage invite control. It allows mods to disable + enable invites along with seeing usage. This is very helpful for raids, you can block more bots joining while the mods get the situation under control.
