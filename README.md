This is Invite Manager, a bot built on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev) for the [Cloudflare Discord](https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev) using the [Slshx](https://github.com/mrbbot/slshx) library.

Made to manage invites, it allows the mods to disable and enable invites along with seeing usage. 

The coolest feature being...[drumroll please!🥁🥁🥁]
While the mods get the situation under control, they prevent more bots to join the server *under siege* or in the case of *raids*.
